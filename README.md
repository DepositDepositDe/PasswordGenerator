Password Generator Documentation
Overview

This Python program generates a random password based on user specifications. It prompts the user for the desired password length and complexity level, then generates a password using random characters from the specified character sets.
How to Run

    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    Copy the provided Python code into a file named password_generator.py.
    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing password_generator.py.
    Run the program by executing the command python password_generator.py.
    Follow the prompts to enter the desired password length and complexity level.
    The program will generate and display the random password.

Functionality
generate_password(length, complexity)

This function takes two parameters:

    length: An integer specifying the desired length of the password.
    complexity: A string indicating the complexity level of the password. Valid values are "low", "medium", or "high".

The function generates a password based on the specified length and complexity level. It utilizes the random.choice() function to select random characters from the appropriate character set.
main()

This function serves as the entry point of the program. It prompts the user for input, calls the generate_password() function to generate the password, and then prints the generated password.
Complexity Levels

    Low: Includes only lowercase letters (a-z) and digits (0-9).
    Medium: Adds punctuation symbols to the character set.
    High: Adds uppercase letters (A-Z) to the character set.

Error Handling

    If the user inputs an invalid complexity level, the program displays an error message and prompts the user to choose from the valid options.

Libraries Used

    random: Used for generating random choices.
    string: Provides sets of ASCII characters for generating passwords.

Example Usage

bash

Enter password length: 10
Enter complexity level (low/medium/high): medium
Generated Password: 5Fptq#-z)S

This documentation provides an overview of the program's functionality, instructions for running it, details about the implemented functions, explanation of complexity levels, error handling, libraries used, and an example usage scenario.
